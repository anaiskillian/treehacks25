# VisionMate 🦾🔵

**An AI-powered assistive suite for the visually impaired.**

VisionMate is a **context-aware AI agent** designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate the world seamlessly. By integrating real-time **text-to-braille conversion, image-to-audio narration, and object-awareness detection**, VisionMate provides an intuitive and accessible experience across multiple platforms.

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Text-to-Braille Conversion** - Converts written text into Braille output for enhanced accessibility.  
🎙️ **Image-to-Audio Narration** - Uses AI-powered object detection and scene description to generate audio descriptions.  
🦾 **Object Awareness Detection** - Detects nearby objects and provides haptic feedback via Apple Watch.  
⌚ **Apple Watch Integration** - Motion-triggered controls and real-time notifications.  
🤖 **Seamless Context Switching** - AI agent determines the best assistive tool automatically.  

## 🛠️ Built With

🔹 **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Apple Core ML, TensorFlow  
💻 **Frontend**: Swift (iOS), TypeScript, React  
🖥 **Backend**: Python, Node.js  
⌚ **Hardware**: Apple Watch (WatchOS)  
📊 **Data Processing**: Accelerometer & Gyroscope Data, Augmented Reality Kit (ARKit)  

## 📸 How It Works

1️⃣ **Real-time Object Detection:** VisionMate detects objects within a 1-foot radius using ARKit.  
2️⃣ **Adaptive AI Decision-Making:** Determines whether to convert text to Braille or narrate the scene via audio.  
3️⃣ **Haptic Feedback for Navigation:** Apple Watch vibrates when an object is detected nearby.  
4️⃣ **Gesture-Based Control:** A thumbs-up gesture stops all AI-generated outputs.  

## 🎯 Our Mission
